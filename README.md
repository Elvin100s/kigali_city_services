## 🔥 Firebase Structure

### Firestore Collections

#### `users`
```json
{
  "uid": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "displayName": "string",
  "emailVerified": "boolean",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "verifiedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

#### `listings`
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "category": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "address": "string",
  "latitude": "double",
  "longitude": "double",
  "phoneNumber": "string",
  "createdBy": "string (UID)",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

#### `email_otps`
```json
{
  "otp": "string (6-digit code)",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "expiresAt": "timestamp",
  "verified": "boolean"
}
```

#### `otp_emails`
```json
{
  "to": "string (email)",
  "subject": "string",
  "html": "string (email body)",
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.0.0)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Firebase account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd kigali_city_services
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Firebase Setup**
   - Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Create a Firestore database
   - Download `google-services.json` (Android) and place in `android/app/`
   - Run Firebase CLI to generate `firebase_options.dart`:
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```

4. **Run the app**
```bash
flutter run
```

## 📦 Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^4.4.0
  firebase_auth: ^6.1.4
  cloud_firestore: ^6.1.2
  provider: ^6.1.1
  flutter_map: ^6.1.0
  latlong2: ^0.9.0
  url_launcher: ^6.2.2
  intl: ^0.18.1
```

## 🎓 State Management Approach

### Provider Pattern
- **AuthProvider** - Manages authentication state, OTP verification, user sessions
- **ListingsProvider** - Handles CRUD operations, search, and filtering for listings

### Service Layer
- **AuthService** - Firebase Authentication operations
- **FirestoreService** - Firestore database operations
- **EmailOtpService** - OTP generation and verification

### Data Flow
```
UI Widget → Provider → Service Layer → Firebase
                ↓
         notifyListeners()
                ↓
         UI Rebuilds (Consumer/Selector)
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- Email verification required before app access
- OTP expires after 10 minutes
- User can only edit/delete their own listings
- Firestore security rules enforce user ownership
- No sensitive data stored locally

## 🧪 Testing on Emulator

### OTP Verification
Since email links don't work well on emulators, we use OTP codes:
1. Sign up with any email
2. Check Firestore `otp_emails` collection for the 6-digit code
3. Enter the code in the app
4. Access granted after verification
